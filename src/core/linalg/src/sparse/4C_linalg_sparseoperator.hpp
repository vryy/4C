    The point in FE simulations is that you have to assemble (element)

    and finally solve the completed system of equations.

    Here we have an interface that has different implementations. The obvious
    one is the SparseMatrix, a single Epetra_CrsMatrix in a box, another one
    is BlockSparseMatrix, a block matrix build from a list of SparseMatrix.

    This is an individual call.  Will only assemble locally and will never

    be ignored.  Will use the communicator and rowmap from matrix to
    determine ownerships.  Local matrix Aele has to be square.

    If matrix is Filled(), it stays so and you can only assemble to places
    already masked. An attempt to assemble into a non-existing place is a
    grave mistake.

    If matrix is not Filled(), the matrix is enlarged as required.

    \note Assembling to a non-Filled() matrix is much more expensive than to
    a Filled() matrix. If the sparse mask does not change it pays to keep
    the matrix around and assemble into the Filled() matrix.

    The first parameter \p eid is purely for performance enhancements. Plain
    sparse matrices do not know about finite elements and do not use the
    element id at all. However, BlockSparseMatrix might be created with
    specialized, problem specific assembling strategies. And these strategies
