  /* A very good tutorial and explanation on how to choose your linear solver and the related
   * parameters can be found here:
   * https://de.mathworks.com/help/matlab/math/iterative-methods-for-linear-systems.html
   *
   * The available methods in 4C are very similar to the ones available in MATLAB:
   *
   * For small problems e.g. smaller than 50.000 global degrees of freedom, choose a direct solver
   * (UMFPACK is very popular and also used as direct solver in MATLAB, you just don't see it).
   *
   * For bigger problems use an iterative method in combination with a preconditioner. A popular
   * choice for symmetric systems is ICC + CG, for non-symmetric problems ILU + GMRES. Also try to
   * use Belos as your iterative solver package of choice!
   *
   * For really big problems use a multigrid preconditioner in combination with an iterative
   * solver. This ensures scalability and realistic computation times. Also try to use MueLU as
   * your multigrid package of choice!
   *
   * In 4C equilibration and reordering is also available, but not for everything yet. An
   * experimental approach on permuting the system matrix to obtain better conditioning and
   * faster solution times is given by the permutation strategy.
