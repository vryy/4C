  \brief A virtual class all elements that are used in DRT have to implement

  This is the pure virtual base class for all finite elements to be used with
  the DRT::Discretization. Every element (and boundary condition) to be used
  with the discretization management module has to implement this class.
  It implements various basic element methods and
  stores basic information such as element to node connectivity.

  For elements that are attached to another 'parent' element, we use the derived
  class FaceElement. All boundary element types as well as interior face element
  classes are of type FaceElement. A FaceElement behaves as a usual Element most
  of the time, but it does have additional query methods for the parent element
  and other connectivity information.
