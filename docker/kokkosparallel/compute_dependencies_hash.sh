# Calculate a hash from our dependencies. Call the script from the project root directory.
# - Find all files and exclude hidden files (like .DS_Store on macOS). Hidden files should not be part of the dependencies.
# - Calculate the SHA1 of every file. The SHA1 is good enough as we don't use it for cryptographic security. No need for SHA256
# - Calculate the final SHA1 from the filenames and their respective SHA1. We include the filename and not only the content to track changes to the dependency structure.
# - Use the first 8 characters of the SHA1 as hash. There is only a low collision probability with 8 characters as the hash is rarely updated.
